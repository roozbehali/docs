## Chat

Butler knows everything about you and your organization. The more time you spend
using Butler and your connected integrations, the more data Butler will have as
context. Initially, Butler fetches a month's worth of data from your connected
integrations.

## Contacts

Butler uses your contacts as context for your summaries and chats. Your "internal"
contacts are people in your organization. You can add external contacts manually
on the _People_ page.

Soon, we'll offer support for automatically importing your contacts from your
email provider or social platforms.

Contacts can be marked as either "urgent" or "not urgent". Urgent contacts will
be prioritized in your summaries and chats.
