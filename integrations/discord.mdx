## Features

Butler is a Discord bot that captures your Discord server's
messages in real-time. On top of capturing data for use in the
main app, the bot has two slash commands:

1. `/summarize` - Butler will generate a summary of your server's messages for the
   past hour.

2. `/ask` - Butler will contextually answer a question about your server's messages.
